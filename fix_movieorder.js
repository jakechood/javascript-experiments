/* Define a method named orderOfAppearance() that takes the name of a role as an argument and returns that role's order of appearance. If the role is not found, the method returns 0. Ex: orderOfAppearance("Elizabeth Swann") returns 3. Hint: A method may access the object's properties using the keyword this. Ex: this.title accesses the object's title property. */
